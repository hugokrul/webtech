        How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 animated action-adventure film
        produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures.
        Directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the film is loosely based on
        the 2003 book of the same name by British author Cressida Cowell.

      <p class="top">
        The movie follows the story of Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), an
        awkward and clumsy Viking teenager who lives on the island of Berk.
        Hiccup is the son of Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler), the village chief,
        and is an outcast among his peers due to his inability to fight dragons.
        Despite this, Hiccup is determined to prove himself and become a
        respected member of the tribe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="top">
        One day, Hiccup stumbles upon a dragon nest and manages to shoot down an
        injured dragon, which he soon names Toothless. After rescuing Toothless,
        Hiccup forms a bond with the creature and discovers a way to train him.
        With the help of his friends, Astrid (America Ferrera) and Gobber (Craig
        Ferguson), Hiccup starts to train Toothless and forms a close bond with
        him.

                Hiccup eventually discovers that the dragons on the island are
                actually peaceful creatures who have been enslaved by the
                vikings. With the help of his newfound allies, Hiccup musters up
                the courage to confront his father and the other vikings to free
                the dragons. He also discovers a hidden dragon sanctuary, where
                the dragons can live in peace.
