<p>How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 animated action-adventure film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, the film is loosely based on the 2003 book of the same name by British author Cressida Cowell.<br>

  The movie follows the story of Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), an awkward and clumsy Viking teenager who lives on the island of Berk. Hiccup is the son of Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler), the village chief, and is an outcast among his peers due to his inability to fight dragons. Despite this, Hiccup is determined to prove himself and become a respected member of the tribe.<br>
<br>
  One day, Hiccup stumbles upon a dragon nest and manages to shoot down an injured dragon, which he soon names Toothless. After rescuing Toothless, Hiccup forms a bond with the creature and discovers a way to train him. With the help of his friends, Astrid (America Ferrera) and Gobber (Craig Ferguson), Hiccup starts to train Toothless and forms a close bond with him.<br>
  <br>
  Hiccup eventually discovers that the dragons on the island are actually peaceful creatures who have been enslaved by the vikings. With the help of his newfound allies, Hiccup musters up the courage to confront his father and the other vikings to free the dragons. He also discovers a hidden dragon sanctuary, where the dragons can live in peace.<br>
<br>
  The movie follows Hiccup and Toothless as they battle against the vikings and the dragons, ultimately leading to a thrilling climax in which Hiccup and his friends save the day. While doing so, Hiccup learns to confront his fears and prove himself to his tribe.<br>
